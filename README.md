This tool has been tested extensively but might contain bugs.  It is strongly suggested that until you are comfortable with the operation of the tool that you limit the ether in the account from which you are sending ENS transactions and that you manually confirm the tool's operations by looking up the relevant transaction and resultant state of your ENS entry in a tool such as etherscan.  If you do find any issues with the tool then please report them so that they can be addressed.
